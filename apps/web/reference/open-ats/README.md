**Transparent, Unlimited, Open-Source ATS Resume Scanning Tool**

A comprehensive resume scanner that emulates commercial ATS tools while providing transparent scoring, complete audit trails, and proof of improvement tracking. Zero black boxes. Unlimited scans. Complete version control.

## Features

- **Transparent Scoring** — All formulas and calculations are visible and auditable
- **Unlimited Scans** — No monthly limits like commercial tools
- **Complete Audit Trail** — Track improvements over time with full version control
- **Multiple Formats** — Markdown, DOCX, PDF, and plain text resumes
- **Actionable Recommendations** — Prioritized suggestions with expected score impact
- **Configurable Weights** — Customize scoring for different job levels (entry, mid, senior, executive)

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install directly from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/jlynshue/open-ats.git

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/jlynshue/open-ats.git
cd open-ats
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Scan a single resume (all formats: md, docx, pdf, txt)
open-ats scan \
    --resume resume.md \
    --job-description jd.txt \
    --output report.json
```

### Planned CLI Commands (Coming Soon)

These commands describe the planned CLI capabilities and will be available in future sprints:

```bash
# Planned (Sprint 9): HTML report output
open-ats scan \
    --resume resume.md \
    --job-description jd.txt \
    --output report.html

# Planned (Sprint 10): batch scan multiple resumes
open-ats batch \
    --resume-dir resumes/ \
    --job-description jd.txt \
    --output-dir reports/

# Planned (Sprint 10): compare two scans to track improvement
open-ats compare \
    --from-scan scan_id_1 \
    --to-scan scan_id_2 \
    --output improvement_report.html
```

## Example Output

```bash
$ open-ats scan \
    --resume resume.md \
    --job-description backend-engineer-jd.txt \
    --output report.json

Scanned resume.md against backend-engineer-jd.txt: score = 72.25 (good). Wrote report.json.

## How It Works

```
Resume Input → Parser → Keyword Matcher → Scorer → Report Generator
                (DOCX/PDF/MD/TXT)  (NLP-based)    (transparent)   (HTML/JSON)
```

### Scoring Pipeline

**1. Parse Resume & Job Description**
Extract structured data using NLP techniques with format detection.

**2. Analyze & Match**
- **Keyword Matching:** Hard skills, soft skills, action verbs, industry keywords
- **Quantification:** Identify achievements with metrics (15%, $1.4B, 10 years)
- **Formatting:** Detect ATS-breaking elements (tables, special characters)
- **Content Quality:** Weak verbs, passive voice, hedging language detection

**3. Score with Transparent Formulas**

```
Overall Score = Σ(Category Score × Weight)

Default Weights:
  Keyword Match:    40%
  Quantification:   20%
  Formatting:       20%
  Content Quality:  20%
```

Each formula is documented and auditable. See [Scoring System](docs/scoring-system.md) for full details.

**4. Generate Report & Track Improvement**
- Detailed HTML/JSON reports with actionable recommendations
- Complete audit trail showing score progression
- Before/after comparisons proving improvement

## Why Open ATS?

Commercial ATS scanners charge $50-90/month for a black box that gives you a score with no explanation of how it was calculated. Open ATS takes the opposite approach: every formula, every weight, and every sub-score is visible and auditable. You get unlimited scans to iterate on your resume without hitting a paywall, and a complete audit trail that proves your improvements over time.

### Commercial Tool Comparison

| Feature | JobScan | Resume Worded | Open ATS |
|---------|---------|---------------|----------|
| Free scans/month | 5 | 2-3 | ∞ Unlimited |
| Scoring transparency | ❌ Black box | ❌ Black box | ✅ Open formulas |
| Audit trail | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Complete |
| Customization | ❌ Fixed | ❌ Fixed | ✅ Configurable |
| Cost | $50-90/mo | $49/mo | ✅ Free |

### Philosophy

- **Transparent:** All algorithms visible. No black boxes.
- **Unlimited:** Iterate freely without subscription limits.
- **Open:** Community-driven development, MIT licensed.

Open ATS was built to solve a real problem: expensive, opaque commercial ATS scanners during job searches. It demonstrates principles I believe in across all technology: transparency, unlimited access, and user control.
